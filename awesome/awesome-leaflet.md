## Leaflet调用方法
使用在线版本
The latest stable Leaflet release is hosted on a CDN ― to start using it straight away, place this in the head of your HTML code:
```javascript
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://cdn.leafletjs.com/leaflet/v0.7.7/leaflet.css" />
<script src="http://cdn.leafletjs.com/leaflet/v0.7.7/leaflet.js"></script>
```    

使用本地版本
 * leaflet.js - This is the minified Leaflet JavaScript code.
 * leaflet-src.js - This is the readable, unminified Leaflet JavaScript, which is sometimes helpful for debugging.
 * leaflet.css - This is the stylesheet for Leaflet.
 * images - This is a folder that contains images referenced by leaflet.css. It must be in the same directory as leaflet.css.
```javascript
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/leaflet.css" />
<script src="/path/to/leaflet.js"></script> <!-- or use leaflet-src.js --!>
```
